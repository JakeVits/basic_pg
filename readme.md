# Goal

The fundamental concepts of computer programming like: variables, constants, arrays, functions, procedures, and data types The course also reviews structured programming techniques with special attention given to program control structures: sequence, selection, repetition Laboratory work covers development of small programs using a high level programming language and an integrated development environment (IDE) for development, testing and debugging


## Problem 1
Make a hangman program

When the program is run, a word from a list variable will be picked randomly. Then the program will create a variable substituting each character as __ for user to guess. By default there are 5 lives available for user to guess, each wrong guess will lost one live, when all lives lost,  the game will end. But if user able to guess the word correctly, the user will win.

Required knowledge:
- split
- join
- len
- random.choice
- while loop


## Problem 2
Story telling base on choices

Simple program that take user input and replace the input to appropriate place and display the storyline.

Required knowledge:
- for loop
- list
- replace
- input


## Problem 3
Zoo Carer, add animal, view how many animals, different type, [food for each animal type, this is a bit advance...]

When the program is run, there are several choices that provide to the user.
1: To add the animal to the zoo: animal, quantity
2: To view how many animal type and quantity
3: Quit


## Problem 4
Rock paper scissor

When run the program, the program will be in a loop:
0: Exit
1: Rock
2: Paper
3: Scissor 
The computer will be randomize before user input as well. Then returns the score.

## Problem 5
Find the biggest integer among three different numbers

Ask user three inputs, and return the biggest integer

## Problem 6
Reverse a word (String type)

Ask user to enter a word, then return in reverse. 
Ex:

apple -> elppa

## Problem 7
Check if an input integer number is a prime

Ask user to input a number and return whether it is a prime number or not.


## Problem 8 - 
Simple Login / Signup

When the program is run, give users three options, one for login, another for signup, and last for exit. If the user enter login, the login should compared with the existing account. If user selected signup, the signup should ask basic information from user like name, username, and password, in which later on user can login with that credential.


## Problem 9
Remove duplicate word or phrase from the list

Consider having a list, just remove the duplicate and return back the list.
